## 1. Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

#### **Unit testing**  
This will be performed by the developer and the QA tester. This is an iterative process where a feature is developed, tested by the developer and then by the QA tester with the input and/or output parameters. Each class and/or activity is tested for functionality as a standalone component.  

#### **Integration testing**  
This testing will be performed by the QA tester. The developer will perform basic testing but will not include extensive testing during this cycle. Testing during this phase will include testing of how the classes interact with each other and the appropriate input and output parameters for each interaction between classes as depicted in the UML design diagram.  

#### **System**  
This testing will be performed by the QA tester. The test will comprise of the end to end process from inception to completion and comprise of the activities that are depicted in the use case diagrams. All of the classes and/or entities will be tested as a holistic unit from beginning to end.  This testing will involve all of the components, as they will exist in the live infrastructure, to ensure that they work together. 

#### **Regression testing**  
This testing will be performed by QA. The scope of this testing is to test for backwards compatibility, aka to test changes to the application to ensure that the older code still works with the new code. The test will use the parameters that was used previously to ensure tested software still performs after the new changes.  

### 1.2 Test Selection

We plan to use unit, integration, system and regression testing of our application. We will utilize black box testing methods for each test. White box testing will be limited to those methods and operations that are clearly defined and necessary to test with white box testing methods. White box testing on these methods will be at the discretion of the team developers. These may include logic heavy methods. 

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

* Every Test passes and satisfies the scenario established in the UML Diagram.  
* Functional testing coverage to ensure that the application behaves as expected based on the functionalities referenced in the UML Diagram functional requirements. 


### 1.4 Bug Tracking


Bugs will be tracked via a team communication forum (i.e. slack, email) and Github. We will be triaged as to the priority, criticality, module and assignee. Once bugs are fixed, they will be re-inserted into the above testing cycles. Enhancement requests are tracked via the same communication forums related and code changes in Github as bugs. Enhancements will have to go through the different phases of the development life cycle (design inception and elaboration, construction, testing and deployment). Enhancements will go through all the phases of testing and will also include regression testing to ensure that the enhancement doesn't break any existing functionality.


### 1.5 Technology

We will use JUnit for testing. This will expedite the testing and make it more efficient for all of the cycles of testing. The automation of this testing will make it more efficient and streamline the testing process. It also makes the input/output parameters more repeatable and less time consuming than manual testing methods.
